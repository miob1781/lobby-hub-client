# LobbyHub

LobbyHub is a satirical full-stack MERN application that connects lobbyists and politicians for their projects. We all would like to make the business of lobbying more transparent, no?

This is the repository for the frontend. Go to the repository for the backend [here](https://github.com/miob1781/lobby-hub-server).

## How it works

- Lobbyists and politicians register at LobbyHub.
- Politicians provide their areas of influence when they register.
- Lobbyists create requests for political services with the desired areas of influence.
- If a proposed service matches their areas of influence, politicians can accept an offer: deal!

## Instructions

- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start`to start the development mode of create-react-app.
- To interact with the backend, create an `.env` file and set `REACT_APP_URL` to the port of the server, which defaults to `5005`.

## Demo
